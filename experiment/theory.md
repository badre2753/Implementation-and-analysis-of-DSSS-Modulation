DSSS stands for Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum, a type of spread spectrum modulation technique used in wireless communications to spread the signal over a wider bandwidth. In DSSS, the data signal is multiplied by a pseudorandom noise (PN) code, which expands the signalâ€™s bandwidth. This method makes the transmission more resistant to interference and eavesdropping while improving signal reliability, particularly in environments with high noise or congestion. DSSS is widely used in wireless communication technologies, such as Wi-Fi, GPS, and some radio control systems for drones

Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) is a technique that:

Spreads the signal over many paths, making it more reliable.

Works with different types of modulation.

Performs well even when signals fade or face interference.

Helps increase the capacity of CDMA systems (used in mobile networks).

Makes communication more private and secure.

Protects against signal jamming.

Improves voice quality.

Is less affected by noise and can work over longer distances.
